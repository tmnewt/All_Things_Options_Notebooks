class BinomialOption:
    '''Creates a single-period two-state option object.
        
        Object calculates price (premium) of single-period option of an arbitrary time period
        Requires current underlying stock price, strike price, price in up state,
        price in down state, risk free rate.
        
        The risk free rate used should reflect the actual rate of interest earned during the time period.
        For instance, if the option is for 6 months, enter the calculated interest rate earned in those 6 months.

        By default, period payoffs for both up and down states are calculated internally.
        User can override these calculated payoffs by passing their own values.
        This is useful for calculating an 'inner' single period of a much larger multi-period option pricing model.
        Consider that the payoffs are not the possible stock values at some arbitrary time before maturity but 
        instead the price of the next binomial period option.

        Dev note: This easily causes confusion, consider breaking apart this functionality.
