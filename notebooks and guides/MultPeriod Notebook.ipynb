    "But at the start of this document I stated that the answer is `$ 4.43`. How do we reconcile this discrepancy? The approach we've been using generated a price of zero, whereas I've been saying the actual price for this example is `4.43`. Again we are presented with the question, \"how do we know when the answer is wrong?\" When we critically think through the most recent step we will see that we made a number of logical errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we did wrong:\n",
    "\n",
    "We assumed that the tool used before could also work here. We saw that the past 2 steps each followed the exact same approach pattern. It's not a stretch to assume this pattern continues forward. However, consider that there is no logical reason for the persistence of this pattern. It might very well be that by chance the first 2 steps followed the same approach. (This will give rise to an important corollary later). In short, we've fallen victim to a \"monkey see, monkey do\" mindset. We are better than that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we found the fair price for this call option 6 months from today when the underlying asset's price rises to `$ 110` and similarly we found the fair price when the underlying asset's price falls to `$ 95`. The call option's prices are `$ 6.98` and `$ 0.00` respectively. Are we to just ignore these values? No! But our approach took one look at those calculations and went \"oh... *guess we don't need these!*\" and threw them out. But these are the values of the call option if we were to sell it in 6 months! They are the payoffs! The work from earlier demonstrated that the option has some intrinsic value when the underlying price rises to `$ 110`. This value in 6 months must carry in part back to today. Else, we could pay nothing for the option today, and pocket `$ 6.98` in 6 months! What a great deal! We would make money from nothing! This illogical situation suggests that 1). the call option today must be worth some positive value, and 2) the call option's value is somewhere between `$ 0.00` and `$ 6.98`. By this logic we must reject that the call option has zero value today!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put some numbers to it for example. Suppose we mispriced our calculation and bought the option today at exactly `$ 6.00`. There is still a chance that we can profit from this mistake! If the underlying price rises to `$ 110` in 6 months which would push the fair market price of the option to `$ 6.98`. We could sell our option at that `6.98` and walk away with `$ 0.98` in profit. (which is the answer to that side question from earlier). Conversely if the underlying price instead falls to `$ 95` we are under no obligation to exercise our option, in which case our profit is zero. It's these payoff states we care about. Recall that these are a vital component in the calculating the fair price of an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the single period binomial option module the payoffs are normally calculated internally but we can override those payoff calculations by passing additional arguments. (Dev note: I'm contemplating moving this feature to its own module in the future, I've opted to bundle this functionality together for now.) The following demonstrates this and produces the answer we've been looking for. "

    "I've introduced continuously compounded rate of `0.05` per year. This is a significant change from the problems above which describe their risk-free rate per period. This change might seem annoying at first but working with continuously compounding makes things easier, especially when dealing with smaller time periods. For an arbitrary length of time *T*, described by *n* distinct periods the following holds:\n",
    "\n",
    "## $$e^r = (e^{r\\Delta t})^n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Where *r* is the continuously compounded risk-free rate \n",
    "* Where $\\Delta t$ is the length of period as a fraction of a year such that $\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{\\#periods/year}$. (For example, if the underlying price can evolve over 2 periods in 1 year then $\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{2}$, if 3 periods then $\\Delta t = \\frac{1}{3}$, etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that make a distinction between the number of periods (which I noted as #periods) and the number of periods which describes the time until maturity, *n*. This is because its entirely possible for $n > periods/year$. Such is the case when the maturity length is greater than 1 year. The main point is to make sure your rates of change make sense. \n",

    "Lastly, the concept of  $\\Delta t$ is important as it will be used in calculating up and down factors.\n",

    "#### NOTE 2:\n",

    "Up until now I've avoided discussing problems that involve volatility. Instead I just skipped to saying that the up and down factors were 'known'. Where did those values come from? Depends, where do you want them to come from? Well, considering these are discrete time problems, they could have come from either Jarrow-Rudd's approach or Cox-Ross-Rubinstein's approach to calculating up and down factors. We will assume that these approaches incorporate risk-neutral probabilities. (I will not be introducing other approaches). By the way, these approaches tend to become more accurate when there are many distinct periods in the multi-period model.\n",
